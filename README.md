* ### **Responsiveness**
    The responsiveness of the website was tested physically on Laptops, Desktops, Big screen, Mobile, Tablets and also using Am I Responsive tool as well as Google Dev Tools Device Mode.
    The website fits and adapts well to the different viewport size devices.

* ### **Usability Testing**
    * This website have been shared to family and friends to add, read, edit and delete recipes none of them experienced any issues during the testing process and it was confirmed that the website was easy to use and navigate. They were able to effectively use the interactive elements of the website, find the information they were looking for and easily understand the purpose of the website. 
* ### **Performance testing**
    Performance testing was carried out using Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools.
    * Desktop Performance was excellent in accessibility.

# **Deployment**
* This website is developed by using Gitpod workspace  and GitHub repository to commit and push changes. This project uses GitHub for hosting and has been deployed using Heroku. 

* Following steps can be used to access the page :-


### **Download**
* Git hub navigate to https://github.com/Bhargavi84/The-Cook-Book
* Click the **Code** button.
* Click the **Download Zip**.
* Extract 

### **Clone Repository**

* GitHub navigate to https://github.com/Bhargavi84/The-Cook-Book
* Click the Code button.
* To clone with HTTPS copy the URL in the box https://github.com/Bhargavi84/The-Cook-Book.git
* Open your Git Bash.
* Changed the directory to the location where you want to clone.
* Type git clone than paste the copied URL git clone https://github.com/Bhargavi84/The-Cook-Book.git
Press Enter , your local clone will be created.

### **Deployment to Heroku**
* **Set up workspace for Heroku**:

    * In the terminal window of IDE, create a requirements.txt file to store all applications and dependencies required to run the app.
    *        pip3 freeze --local . requirements.txt

    * Create a Procfile (strictly capital P and no file extension!) - required by Heroku, to know which file runs the app.

    *       echo web: python app.py > Procfile
    
* **Create application in Heroku**:

    * Navigate to [Heroku website](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) and create an account.
    * Once logged in, click on the New button and select Create New App
    * Create a name for your app and select the region closest to your location.

* **Connect your app to GitHub repository**:

    * On the Deploy page, select GitHub as your Deployment method.
    * You will then be prompted to find the github repository, click on Connect button to connect.
    * Click on the Settings  and select Config Vars and Reveal Config Vars.
    * Add the following variables (as stored in env file):

    ![plot](static/images/env.png)
In the IDE terminal, push the two new files to the GitHub repository:

        git add requirements.txt
        git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"  
        git add Procfile
        git commit -m "Add Procfile"
        git push
* Now go back to Heroku and click on Enable Automatic Deployment and Deploy Branch.

* The app is now connected and Heroku will receive the code from GitHub and automatically update whenever changes is pushed to the GitHub repository. You should be able to see "Your app was successfully deployed!". Click on View to launch your app.
* Click on Open App to test your deployed website.



### **Creating env file**

Install Flask, in the terminal type pip3 install Flask , this will install Flask functionality. Create env.py file for storing sensitive data, type touch env.py in terminal. This file should never be pushed to GitHub, so type touch .gitignore to ignore it. Then open the .gitignore file and ignore your env.py file type:

In the env.py file we need to hide several bits of data. Open env.py file and type:

## **Fork the project**

* To create a personal copy of this repository, click on Fork button on the top right corner of the repository page in GitHub.

### **Database Access**
To create the data schema in MongoDB Atlas, create a new database called cook_book, add three collections called 
categories, recipes and users.

###  cook_book 
* categories
    * _id:ObjectId
    * category_name
* recipes
    * _id:ObjectId
    * category_name
    * recipe_name
    * recipe_ingredients should be set into an array
    * recipe_instruction should be set into an array
    * recipe_img
    * prep_time
    * cook_time
    * serves
    * created_by
* users
    * _id:ObjectId
    * username
    * password
